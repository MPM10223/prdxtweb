\f1\'b7\tab\f0 You may not test the software in a live operating environment unless Microsoft permits you to do so under another agreement.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-357\li357\sb120\sa120\b 2.\tab TERM.\b0  The term of this agreement is one year, or commercial release of the software, whichever is first.\par
\b 3.\tab PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. \b0 This software is a pre-release version. It may not work the way a final version of the software will. We may change it for the final, commercial version. We also may not release a commercial version.\par
\b 4.\tab THIRD PARTY NOTICES. \b0 The software may include third party code that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code are included for your information only. Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly granted by this agreement.\b\par
5.\tab FEEDBACK. \b0 If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.\par
\b 6.\tab SCOPE OF LICENSE.\b0  The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not\par

\f1\'b7\tab\f0 reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;\par
\f1\'b7\tab\f0 make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;\par

\f1\'b7\tab\f0 transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or\par
\f1\'b7\tab\f0 use the software for commercial software hosting services.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-357\li357\sb120\sa120\b 7.\tab EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.\b0  The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK www.microsoft.com/exporting }}{\fldrslt{www.microsoft.com/exporting\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs20 .\par
\b 8.\tab SUPPORT SERVICES. \b0 Because this software is \ldblquote as is,\rdblquote  we may not provide support services for it.\par
\b 9.\tab ENTIRE AGREEMENT.\b0  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li360\sb120\sa120\b 10.\tab APPLICABLE LAW.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-363\li720\sb120\sa120 a.\tab United States.\b0  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.\par
\b b.\tab Outside the United States.\b0  If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-357\li357\sb120\sa120\b 11.\tab LEGAL EFFECT.\b0  This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.\par

\pard\widctlpar\fi-357\li357\sb120\sa120\b 12.\tab DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed \ldblquote as-is.\rdblquote  You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights or statutory guarantees under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li357\sb120\sa120 FOR AUSTRALIA \endash  You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in these terms is intended to affect those rights.\par

\pard\widctlpar\fi-357\li357\sb120\sa120 13.\tab LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li357\sb120\sa120\b0 This limitation applies to\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-363\li720\sb120\sa120\f1\'b7\tab\f0 anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and\par
\f1\'b7\tab\f0 claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li360\sb120\sa120 It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.\par

\pard\widctlpar\sb120\sa120\b Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.\par
Remarque : Ce logiciel \'e9tant distribu\'e9 au Qu\'e9bec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en fran\'e7ais.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sb120\sa120\lang1036 EXCLUSIONS DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel est conc\'e9d\'e9 sous licence \'ab\~en l\rquote\'e9tat\~\'bb. Vous assumez tous les risques li\'e9s \'e0 son utilisation. Microsoft n\rquote accorde aucune garantie ou condition expresse. Vous pouvez b\'e9n\'e9ficier de droits des consommateurs suppl\'e9mentaires dans le cadre du droit local, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. Lorsque cela est autoris\'e9 par le droit local, Microsoft exclut les garanties implicites de qualit\'e9, d\rquote ad\'e9quation \'e0 un usage particulier et d\rquote absence de contrefa\'e7on.\par

\pard\widctlpar\sb120\sa120\b0\lang1033\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\sb120\sa120\b\lang1036 LIMITATION ET EXCLUSION DE RECOURS ET DE DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs limit\'e9e uniquement \'e0 hauteur de 5,00 $ US.

\pard\nowidctlpar\li360\sb120\sa120 Elle s\rquote applique \'e9galement m\'eame si Microsoft connaissait l'\'e9ventualit\'e9 d'un tel dommage. La limitation ou exclusion ci-dessus peut \'e9galement ne pas vous \'eatre applicable, car votre pays n\rquote autorise pas l\rquote exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilit\'e9 pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit.\par

\pard\widctlpar\sb120\sa120\lang1033\par
\b EFFET JURIDIQUE\b0 . Le pr\'e9sent contrat d\'e9crit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d\rquote autres droits pr\'e9vus par les lois de votre pays. Le pr\'e9sent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous conf\'e8rent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.\par
